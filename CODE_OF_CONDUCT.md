# Code Warriors Pledge

The Warriors pledge instead of an actual  code of conduct. This is needed when class 
names are now considered political (like names with master). Unlike CoC it is up
 to you to understand what this implies. It is similar to various warrior 
 pledges, execept it is for writting code. The basic is that you focus on writing 
 code code no matter the ciscumstances and not let yourself become the next 
 victim of politcs and other nonsense that is unehalthy to you and your code.
 There are plenty of Russian dissidents from the Soviet Union that can describe
 the bad effects bad politics can have on society and why this pledge is badly needed
in "current year".
